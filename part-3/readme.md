In 2011, Sony's Playstaion Network was hacked. About 77 million accounts (Playstation PSN) were compromised and personal informations were exposed. Sony stated it was due to an "external intrusion". In other words, it was caused by Security hackers that explore and expose weakenesses in a computer system/network defenses. Sony's weakness was their lack of encryoted information. Many of the user's infromation were not encrypted strongly. It allowed external hackers and other employees within the company to obtain users personal information easily. Due to the hacking, Sony had to shut down the Playstation Network for a long time. Afterwards, Sony continued releasing updated firmware and security patches.
